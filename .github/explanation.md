Let’s break this down carefully — all of these are **common steps in a GitHub Actions workflow**, but some details may vary depending on your project.

---

### 1️⃣ `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

* **Purpose:** Ensures the workflow uses the **latest version of pip** before installing packages.
* Why: Some packages (like `mkdocs` or plugins) may require newer pip features.
* Optional: If you’re okay with the default pip version on the runner, you can skip it, but upgrading is a safe practice.

---

### 2️⃣ `github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`

* This is used by `actions-gh-pages` to **authenticate** and push changes to the `gh-pages` branch.
* GitHub automatically provides a `GITHUB_TOKEN` for workflows. You **don’t need to create it manually**.

---

### 3️⃣ `- name: Checkout repository / uses: actions/checkout@v3`

* This step pulls the **source code from your repository** into the workflow runner.
* `@v3` is the version of the action — this is the latest stable major version.
* **You always need this** if you want to work with your repo’s files (docs, mkdocs.yml, etc.).

---

### 4️⃣ `- name: Set up Python / uses: actions/setup-python@v4`

* Sets up a **Python environment** of the specified version on the runner.
* Needed because GitHub runners don’t have your preferred Python version by default.
* You can change `python-version: '3.x'` to match your project requirements.

---

### 5️⃣ `- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages / uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v6`

* This action **pushes your generated site to the `gh-pages` branch**.
* `@v6` is the version of the action; newer versions might have extra features.
* You specify `publish_dir` (the folder to deploy, usually `./site`) and optionally `publish_branch` (default is `gh-pages`).

### ✅ Which parts are **usually the same** and which can change

| Step                                              | Usually Same | May Change / Customize            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Checkout repo (`actions/checkout@v3`)             | ✅            | Usually version only              |
| Set up Python (`actions/setup-python@v4`)         | ✅            | Python version                    |
| Upgrade pip                                       | Optional     | Can skip or keep                  |
| Install dependencies (`pip install ...`)          | Custom       | Depends on your docs plugins      |
| Build MkDocs site (`mkdocs build`)                | Custom       | Path/config may vary              |
| Deploy GH Pages (`peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v6`) | ✅            | `publish_branch` or `publish_dir` |

---

So in short:

* **Most steps are standard**, especially checkout, setup Python, and deploy.
* **Install commands, Python version, folder paths, and plugins** are project-specific and should match your docs setup.
